# Rusty-darwinian-divingbell
An atempt to try some Rust programming, I decided to try and make a Library in Rust for running genetic algorithms.
This is as much a project for learning Rust as for making a fast and efficient way of running genetic algorithms. 

## Example of use
The lib.rs file contains a unit test that shows a use of the library. But the idea is really to import the library into other projects.

The test optimization problem shown in the unit test can be described as: In an array of 25 boolean (critters), give one score point for every critter which hasnÂ´t a neighbouring critter. Then stop if the score reaches 13 points. 


## Plantuml
There is a plantuml that shows how the control-flow of the library is supposed to work, but all functionality is not implemented (yet).

## Unimplemented features
Some algorithms might want to use imprecise simulations to calculate their score, it would be nice to implement a t-test or z-score or similar to decide if a solution is better than another in these cases.

Crossover mutation, a function that takes several (or just two) different genomes, and produces a new child genome.

Multi-threading, it would be nice to be able to run the genetic algorithm in several threads simultaniously.

Scoring of mutators and crossover-mutators, could help select the best mutation and speed up the process.

## Terminology
### Genome
Any datastructure describing a solution, usually an array of booleans, enums or numbers. However, this can also be another structure, such as a tree
structure. One requirement is that the genome must implement a clone method. The user of the library supplies a function for producing new untested genomes.
### Mutator
A function for making an existing genome into a new genome, slightly mutated. The user of the library supplies a vector of mutator functions which performs valid mutations.  

## The API
`fn run_simulation<GenomeType: Clone>(
    new_genome: fn() -> GenomeType,
    score_fn: fn(genome: &GenomeType) -> f64,
    output: fn(genome: &GenomeType),
    mutators: Vec<fn(genome: &GenomeType) -> GenomeType>,
    finish: fn(high_score: f64) -> bool,
)`
